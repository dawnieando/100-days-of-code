# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: February 15, 2020

Today's Progress**: Worked through Sololearn Python Certification

Thoughts:** I'm finding that much of the code base is similar to other languages so lots of familiarity.  I've taken this course before but a lot of it didn't sink in and I was overall not happy with my understanding, so started it again. Trying to consume and really think about this more. Completed sections on basic concepts, control structures, functions & modules and exceptions and files today.  I'm about 40% through the certification at this point.

## Keeping the 100 days of code log examples below in place to follow a format

### Day 1: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through SoloLearn Python Certification (more types and functional programming). 

**Thoughts**: Need to explore more around some items which weren't really sticking such as Lambdas and Yield.  Now about 60% through the certification. It's evident however that simply doing the course is just the very, very start of being competent in this area but the building blocks matter.  Peter Nikolow also alerted me to some free learning resources on Packt Publishing which are relevant to the study direction I'm taking too. There are a lot of good materials on Python, Machine Learning and e.g. Docker 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Python 3 Certification on SoloLearn

**Thoughts**: It's only a start but I am pleased I completed this.  Now to find more Python challenges to try to make it stick properly.

### Day 2: February 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through some W3C Python tutorials and installed Pycharm

**Thoughts** I didn't get a huge amount done today due to travelling for most of the day.

### Day 3: February 18th 2020

**Today's Progress: Still working through W3 schools exercises on Python. Lots of cross-over with Sololearn of course but its sinking in now (eg differences between lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets). Digressing to maths to learn more about complex numbers.  

Second update for the day - did some more on Python W3 Schools. Completed all the Python exercises in W3 Schools Python section altough there are still a lot of areas I want to go through again.  Starting to stick further.  The exercises were getting much easier toward the end and work off lots of repetition and quirky 'fill in the gaps' exercises.

### Day 4 and Day 5: February 19th 2020 and 20th 2020

**Today's Progress: It's a juggle when travelling.  Moving into the conditionals section of Python on W3 Schools now.  I've done them before with Sololearn but will help solidify.  I will sign up for the Google new course on automation with Python today

**Day 6: February 21st 2020**

**Today's Progress: Travelling and learning Python

19 hours of travelling involved 3 flights and 4 airports so grabbing time to do 100 days of code in various international lounges.  I signed up for Google' new Python automation course so began that and used the time to get ahead.  Already into week 2 of the 5 week long course.  Some was completed at 39,000 feet via airplane wifi.

**Day 7: February 22nd 2020**

**Today's Progress:** Week 2 of Google new Automation with Python Certification. Moving into much more code than previously.  Working out calculations / time (hours / mins / seconds), distance calculators and miles / km converter tools

**Thoughts** Flew through week 1 on the Google course whilst in the airports yesterday.  Today am onto week 2 but the quizes and exercises are much more practical code edits.

### Day 8: February 23rd 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed week 2 of the Google Python Automation Certification.  Increasingly the challenges involve creating scripts from scratch or debugging script examples.  Started Week 3 of the course early.  Some very challenging exercises (for me anyway).

**Thoughts** I can see increasingly where I can use Python in my everyday work.

**Day 9 and Day 10: February 24th and February 25th 2020**

**Today's Progress:** Part way through week 4 of the Google Python Automation Certification.  Working on string manipulation and string formatting.  Trying simple scripts and calculators.  Having to keep going over things again and again at the moment.  

**Thoughts** More and more bits are sticking and it's getting easier to write some small scripts without thinking too hard or making mistakes.

**Day 11: February 26th 2020** Day 11 of #100daysofcode and I am learning about enumerate function on tuples and I have no clue what is happening.  Need to keep learning.

**Day 12: February 27th 2020** See below

**Day 13: February 28th 2020** - #100daysofcode days 12 and 13.  Working through the graded assessment for week 4 of the Google IT automation with Python course.  Taking me ages to work out the questions and getting lots wrong before eventually getting some right.  Python does some weird things

**Day 14: February 29th 2020** - #100DaysOfCode now through dictionaries and sets and tonight I will do my study with a rhubarb gin and vimto Friday night treat

**Day 15: March 1st 2020** - Day 15 Update 3 #100DaysOfCode - I'm not confident I know what I've gone through on the first few weeks of material on the Google IT automation with Python course so I'm going to go through it again from the beginning.  Hopefully I'll be more confident then

**Day 16: March 2nd 2020** 

**Today's Progress** Very late to do my #100DaysOfCode today. Day 14. Started again from week 1 to make sure I understand on Google IT automation with Python course. Went through to Week 2 very quickly. At least something stuck. Working through syntax and structures again now. Want good foundations

**Day 17: March 3rd 2020**

**Today's Progress:** Doing the #100daysofcode early today to get it out of the way before work. Revisiting the rest of week 2 again on Google IT automation with Python course.  Revisiting functions and values. Very similar to other languages.  Want good foundations.

**Day 18: March 4th 2020**

**Today's Progress:** Almost gone through first 4 weeks worth of Google IT Automation with Python. It's starting to become much clearer to me. Working through lists, dictionaries, tuples & sets. To break up screen time I am also working through Python Data Science for Dummies

**Thoughts** Starting from the beginning of the course and working through it quickly again is highly recommended.  The second sweep through is making things much more solid in my mind.
