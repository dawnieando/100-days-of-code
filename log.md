# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: February 15, 2020

Today's Progress**: Worked through Sololearn Python Certification

Thoughts:** I'm finding that much of the code base is similar to other languages so lots of familiarity.  I've taken this course before but a lot of it didn't sink in and I was overall not happy with my understanding, so started it again. Trying to consume and really think about this more. Completed sections on basic concepts, control structures, functions & modules and exceptions and files today.  I'm about 40% through the certification at this point.

### Day 1: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through SoloLearn Python Certification (more types and functional programming). 

**Thoughts**: Need to explore more around some items which weren't really sticking such as Lambdas and Yield.  Now about 60% through the certification. It's evident however that simply doing the course is just the very, very start of being competent in this area but the building blocks matter.  Peter Nikolow also alerted me to some free learning resources on Packt Publishing which are relevant to the study direction I'm taking too. There are a lot of good materials on Python, Machine Learning and e.g. Docker

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
