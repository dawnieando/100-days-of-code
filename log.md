# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: February 15, 2020

Today's Progress**: Worked through Sololearn Python Certification

Thoughts:** I'm finding that much of the code base is similar to other languages so lots of familiarity.  I've taken this course before but a lot of it didn't sink in and I was overall not happy with my understanding, so started it again. Trying to consume and really think about this more. Completed sections on basic concepts, control structures, functions & modules and exceptions and files today.  I'm about 40% through the certification at this point.
